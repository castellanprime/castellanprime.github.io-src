Slug:about-me

My name is Okusanya Oluwadamilola. 

I am currently a software engineer. 

I am putting this blog together to detail my journey through various languages, frameworks, toolkits to solve interesting real-world problems. The blog is also one of my (hopefully several) ways of giving back to the software engineering development community. 

In my spare time, I read about everything CS [r/osdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/), [r/systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/systems/), [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org) and so on. If the blog's content interest you in any way or there is something that I wrote that is erroneous, please contact me at *okusanya.damilola@gmail.com*
